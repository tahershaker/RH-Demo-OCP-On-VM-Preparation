## Repo Description

This repository is dedicated to demo environment preparation. Its primary purpose is to provide all required step-by-step guides, scripts, Ansible playbooks and roles, configuration files, and supporting tools needed to automate repetitive tasks involved in building a demo lab on top of VMware infrastructure.

The lab is prepared using a bastion host and is designed to support the deployment and management of Red Hat OpenShift for demo, enablement, and learning use cases. The focus is on creating a repeatable, consistent, and automation-driven environment that closely resembles real-world enterprise setups while remaining optimized for demonstrations rather than production workloads.
